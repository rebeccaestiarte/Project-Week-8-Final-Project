## Project Snapshot
Analysis of Mindful Meditation Practice impact over electroencephalogram (EEG) using brainwaves data acquired through headband sensor.

## Main Hypotesis
The hipotesis is that the practice of Mindful Meditation affect the brainwaves activity even for inexperienced meditators. I also want to prove that the change in brainwaved frequency pattern experienced in meditation is beneficial for the practicioner.

## Dataset
I collected all the data used in this project using the Muse wearable brain sensing headband, manufactured by InteraXon. I was able to measure the brain activity of a sample group via 4 electroencephalography (EEG) sensors placed on the headband. As Interaxon has retired from the market his Software Developer Kit (SDK), I used a third party app named "Mind Monitor" to retrieve the data. The app is able to process the EEG data and output a single combined average value for the five absolute brain wave values. It can output the data into Excel compatible CSV (Comma Separated Values) files that I directly uploaded into a Google Drive folder from my smartphone.

## Cleaning
Describe your full process of data wrangling and cleaning. Document why you chose to fill missing values, extract outliers, or create the variables you did as well as your reasoning behind the process.

## Analysis
* Overview the general steps you went through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work.
* If you used Machine Learning in your final project, describe your feature selection process.

## Model Training and Evaluation


## Conclusion
* Summarize your results. What do they mean?
* What can you say about your hypotheses?
* Interpret your findings in terms of the questions you try to answer.

## Future Work
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What were the steps?
How did you test the accuracy of your analysis and/or machine learning algorithm?

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and trello/kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
